<h1>Cafe Stock Management APP - Explanation and Screenshots (also video rec at my website) (https://portfolio.buyshirtsandstuff.com/)</h1>

I have coded a stock and place order application run on C#, winforms, xml and SQL for a hypothetical cafe.  

In the Application you can place orders and print bills for customers
*Add new stock items via the admin login; 
*Add to the inventory (via SQL database);
*Also, you can Delete items and Update the details of the stock items via the application GUI which will send the commands to the SQL Database;

Please see the majority of the code housed in my repository folders, this is currently designed to work on my laptop and connect to my internal SQL databases, however in the near future I will create a sister project, whereby the project runs from an external SQL source, to make the app more flexible and show knowledge of network data manipulation.

*Also in the future I will upgrade this application's looks and the way the features are used, so the Hypothetical user may gain a better user experience.  Finally I will do
A video live capture of using the application and post this onto my website (subdomain address) so that if anyone/ employers are interested in the knowledege and design they
can see the app working and and an overview of each section and brief exposure to the code alongside the application video.
