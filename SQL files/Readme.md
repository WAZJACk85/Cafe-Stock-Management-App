This folder holds the SQL Files from the project and I have noted the Queries I have used in the creation of the tables below.

As you can also see in the image Above, I have created a basic items dbo table, and this is connected to my app in such a way that the application when information is inputted and sent, via a click will add, remove, update and place orders to be summed and totalled (then printed in pdf).
